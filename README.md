# Portfolio
Hi, my name is Rashon and welcome to my portfolio. I did this as part of CUNY's Micro Credential course and hope this will showcase what I've learned over the last five weeks.
-NOTE: all credits for any images I used that are not of me goes to the artists, writers, developers, publishers, etc of said images. This also applies to the character information on the Apex Legends section. I did not create, draw, nor write those characters or their biographies.
